## What is it?

This is a Sublime-Text 2/3 package designed to help you get started with making HTML files with markdown syntax for writing content via [StrapdownJS](http://strapdownjs.com/).

Works Great with [Strapdown Markdown Preview](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Strapdown%20Markdown%20Preview)!

## Why Make this?

I was digging around for snippets for the basic example StrapdownJS boilerplate that is found on the StrapdownJS website itself, but I didn't find any while writing my documentation so I made one myself

## Installation

### Manual
*Note: I copied the following from the packagecontro.io website*

1. Just open the *Preferences > Browse Packages* menu
2. Browse up a folder and then into the *Installed Packages/* folder
3. Download *Strapdownjs_boilerplate.sublime-package* and copy it into the *Installed Packages/* directory
4. Restart Sublime Text

### Sublime-Text Package Control ~~(coming soon)~~
*Note (4/4/17): I have to set this up later on and get approval by the good people at Sublime-Text Package Control. So take this section as a placeholder for now.*

1. Start Sublime-Text 2/3
2. Press *Ctrl+Shift+p* (Windows, Linux) or *CMD+Shift+p)* (Mac OS); All Package Control commands begin with *Package Control:*, so start typing *Package*.
3. The command pallete will now show a number of commands. Select *Package Control: Install Package* and then type "StrapdownJS" and select "StrapdownJS BoilerPlate"

## How do I Use It?
Type on your new tab or window ```strapdownjs``` and hit <kbd>Tab</kbd>
